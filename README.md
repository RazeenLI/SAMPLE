Is python a good programming language? Why or why not?
    its cross-platform compatibility because it unlimited for every line
    Python was used for parts that required rapid delivery and maintenance because it is easy to write and easy to Compline without thinkking to much bugs
    Python is slow. Like, really slow. On average, you’ll need about 2–10 times longer to complete a task with Python than with any other language.
    One of them is that it’s dynamically typed — remember that you don’t need to specify data types like in other languages. This means that a lot of memory needs to be used, because the program needs to reserve enough space for each variable that it works in any case. And lots of memory usage translates to lots of computing time.
